# DataWranglingProject
This a final project from data wrangling
Since the extra dataset is greater than the limitation of uploading, transform it to a zip file. Please decompress it and then the code would work. 
Acquire data from IMDb api website by searching through https://imdb-api.com/api.

df_250movies: dataset from imdb api with top250 movies.
df_250m_ex: merged dataset for top 250.
df_popumovies: dataset from imdb api with popular movies.
df_popu_ex: merged dataset for popular.

Including this file, there are three more files with adjusting time after 11:59pm in 5.7 (REPORT.Rmd, REPORT.html, REPORT.pdf). This because after I uploaded all the files, I wanted to simulate the path in the file uploaded from canvas and look at the report, and found that the report in html format could not be opened on github. After opening it, there was a bunch of codes instead of sentences and figures. So I re-knit a pdf document. Sorry for the late submission due to some unreadable problems in the html report.
